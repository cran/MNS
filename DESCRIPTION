Description: An implementation of the mixed neighbourhood selection (MNS) algorithm. The MNS algorithm can be used to estimate multiple related precision matrices. In particular, the motivation behind this work was driven by the need to understand functional connectivity networks across multiple subjects. This package also contains an implementation of a novel algorithm through which to simulate multiple related precision matrices which exhibit properties frequently reported in neuroimaging analysis.
